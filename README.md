## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

---

### What I Learned

During this project, I improved my understanding of **Flexbox** for layout structuring and how to use `object-fit` to maintain image aspect ratio while applying `border-radius`.  
One interesting thing I learned was how to **apply hover effects** dynamically:

```css
.blog-title:hover {
  color: #f4d04e; /* Changes text to yellow on hover */
  transition: color 0.3s ease;
}

### Continued development

For future projects, I plan to:

- Explore more complex layouts using **CSS Grid**.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Object Fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - Helped me fix the image border-radius issue.
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A great reference while positioning elements.
